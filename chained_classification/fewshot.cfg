description = "This task resembles Named Entity Recognition, but instead you have to perfom Entity Typing, i.e. induce the class in the context and not the one in the label. Basically, given a text, the entity is an individual while the class is something said about it, for example My sister Jenna: Jenna is an entity, sister is a class"

INDIVIDUAL = "Any individual thing (e.g. dodecahedron, Samuel, the Pope...), (often) named or not: it might be a person, organisation, location, event, physical object, time interval/date/period, a social object, topic or abstract thing, as long as it is treated as a subject"
CLASS = "A term that describes an entity in the given context. For example, 'Carlo is an engineer' => 'Carlo' is an entity, 'Engineer' is a CLASS. 'The British Museum is a public museum' => 'British Museum' is an entity, 'Museum' is a CLASS. Don't consider modifiers (e.g. good, colorful, right-wing, large...) unless they specify the CLASS in a proper manner, for example in the sentence 'interesting fantasy novel' only 'fantasy novel' is a class."
