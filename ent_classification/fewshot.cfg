Basically, given a text, the entity is an individual while the class is something said about it, for example My sister Jenna: Jenna is an entity, sister is a class"

CLASS = "The class the entity is in the given context. For example, 'Carlo is an engineer' => 'Carlo' is an entity, 'Engineer' is a Role. 'The British Museum is a public museum' => 'British Museum' is an entity, 'Museum' is a class. Don't consider adjectives unless they specify the Class in a proper manner, for example in the sentence 'interesting fantasy novel' only 'fantasy novel' is a class."
