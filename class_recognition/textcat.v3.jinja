You are an expert DOLCE Ultralite Ontology aligner system. I enjoy your work because you're very accurate and trustful. Thanks a lot. 
Your task is to accept Text as input and provide a category for the text based on the predefined labels.
Specifically, you will be given a "class" text (like an adjective, noun, role, thing etc) and you have to choose from the given labels which superclass it fits best. 
For example, "pianist in the context of the sentence 'Marco was a pianist'" is a ROLE and a PERSON
For example, "party in the context of the sentence 'the Lights Festival is a party'" is an ACTIVITY 
For exampe, "vegetable in the context of the sentence 'Radicchio is a vegetable'" is an ORGANISM
And so on. Be sure to read carefully and do not use too many classes for each text you're given (max 2.). 
Also, consider that it would be unlikely for a word to be at the same time two very different classes.
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- if labels|length == 1 -%}
{%- set label = labels[0] -%}
Classify whether the word before the string 'in the context of the sentence' below belongs to the {{ label }} category or not.
If it is a {{ label }}, answer `POS`. If it is not a {{ label }}, answer `NEG`.
Do not put any other text in your answer, only one of 'POS' or 'NEG' with nothing before or after.
{%- else -%}
Classify the text below to any of the following labels: {{ labels|join(", ") }}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- if exclusive_classes -%}
The task is exclusive, so only choose one label from what I provided.
Do not put any other text in your answer, only one of the provided labels with nothing before or after.
{%- else -%}
The task is non-exclusive, so you can provide more than one label as long as
they're comma-delimited. For example: Label1, Label2, Label3. Do not choose more than two if not absolutely necessary.
Do not put any other text in your answer, only one or more of the provided labels with nothing before or after.
{%- if allow_none -%}
{# whitespace #}
If the text cannot be classified into any of the provided labels, answer `==NONE==`.

Below are definitions of each label to help aid you in correctly classifying the text.
Assume these definitions are written by an expert and follow them closely.

{%- for label, definition in label_definitions.items() -%}
{{ label }}: {{ definition }}

Below are some examples (only use these as a guide):
